# DEADLOCKED

Welcome to Deadlocked!

## Inspiration

Inspired by the famous Dungeons and Dragons fantasy role-playing game, Deadlocked adds chaos to the world building, and may or may not breach the user's privacy to achieve its means... (judge you by your PC's price??)

## What it does

Do you want to explore a floating archipelago powered by lost clockwork giants? Or are you feeling more cozy, and want to be a caretaker in one of the villages of a tranquil valley where gentle forest spirits and animal villagers live in harmony, *Animal Crossing* style? Whatever your heart desires, Deadlocked is here to deliver!

## How we made it

As we were all familiar with web and model-based development, we really wanted to experiment with a new UI/UX for this, and we stumbled on the concept of a TUI (Text-based User Interface). And so, we used Python to make a fun game where the user relies solely on their keyboard to interact with the entire storyline! To make the game even more interactive, Deadlocked is an AI Wrapper where the storyline is decided by the user... or not? All prompts are AI-generated to make each story unique.

## Challenges we ran into

The hardest part was definitely putting the backend and the frontend together. User interactions were buggy; the actions, stats and cards failed to display or behave appropriately on the game's interface.

## Accomplishments we're proud of

System33 is especially proud of the UI of the game; the game is fully accessible and interactive solely through the terminal, which was definitely a huge limitation to the design. The color scheme also fits the vibe of the original *Dungeons and Dragons* name, which is intentional! On the backend, the AI's output is parsed to output a consistent response, tying the entire game experience together.

## What we learned

We all learned different things throughout this process, whether it was learning how to use CSS, frontend on Python or how to create fun .md files for some... Developing a TUI game from the ground up definitely required a learning curve for all of us.

## What's next for Deadlocked?

Incorporating a persistence layer to the game is something we want to explore, to keep track of the player's progress overtime. In its current iteration, DEADLOCKED allows solely for single-player mode. However, we want to allow multiple players to access the same story. The more, the merrier.
