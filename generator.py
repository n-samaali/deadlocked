      make a dungeons and dragons game where you are the dungeon master and you have to give me exactly 4 options. 
      context would be in a old tech company. output the four options (strength, dexterity, intelligence, charsima) in 
      a clear markdown table to be parsed (Extract rows of the form: | **Strength** | description |). There will be a turn logic where a card will be randomly pulled from the deck and each numbered card will scale the option
      and each figure (J,Q,K) returns an event. The card that was pulled will be provided to you and included in the next event in this format (2H:).
      For each turn, you have to follow the same context (We will feed you back the option that was chosen, but provide answers in a consisten format). Also, the
      character will have hp that will increase or decrease depending on the events. We will also provide the stats, do not assume stats, they will be handled
      programatically, you just have to keep that in mind.
      also output the dungeon maser prompts in a SEPERATE code block.
